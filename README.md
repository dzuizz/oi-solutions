# 🃏 OI-Solutions

_This repository features code solutions to various **Informatics Olympiad** competitions_

## 🐥 Codebase structure

Currently, the codebase only contains raw code files as answers to the various problems.

## 📡 Future Steps

However, several improvements are due to bring the repository beyond just a solution database possibly including the following:

1. Word editorials to go through every (selected) questions.
2. A webapp to parse through the solutions => possibly expanding into an educational wiki for inspiring **Competitive Programmers**
